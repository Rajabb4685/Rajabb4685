📍 New York City, NY  
🎓 Bachelor of Arts in **Computer Science**, Hunter College, CUNY 

## 👨‍💻 About Me
Hello! 👋 I'm Rajab ✨. 

I attend CUNY Hunter College as a junior. I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics. I started coding in middle school, when the Hour of Code by Code.org convinced me that coding was way more fun than recess.

On campus 🏫, I'm a project lead for the Project Development Program, where I oversee a engineering team, managing both the technical direction and overall project execution.

I’m gaining hands-on experience applying machine learning in real-world industry programs. I currently serve as an Machine Learning and AI Fellow with Allstate and Break Through Tech AI, where I develop and evaluate predictive models, improve performance metrics, and collaborate on data-driven solutions focused on fairness, interpretability, and business impact.
